# CSC470-Cloud-Project
Final Project for CSC 470 - Cloud Computing

# Current Progress
Basic chat room implemented - this starting point will later be adapted as a question feed

# How to Test
- Currently, this has not been configured to run on a cloud instance
- Run the command ```node server.js``` to run the server
- Go to your web browser and navigate to localhost:3000
- Open multiple tabs with the chat room and enjoy

Note: If the app is not compiling, run ```npm install``` then ```npm update``` to update the dependencies
